- Write a program to read two polynomials and store them in two arrays.
- Calculate the sum of the two polynomials.
- Display the first polynomial, second polynomial, and the resultant polynomial.

#### 2. Sparse Matrices Operations
- Write a C program to enter two sparse matrices in normal form.
- Implement the following operations as separate functions:
  - a) Conversion of matrix to tuple form.
  - b) Display the matrix in tuple form.
  - c) Find the transpose of a matrix represented in tuple form.
  - d) Find the sum of the two matrices in tuple form.

#### 3. Stack Implementation
- Write a menu-driven program to implement a Stack using arrays with the following operations:
  - a) Pushing elements to the Stack.
  - b) Popping element from the Stack.
  - c) Display the contents of the Stack.

#### 4. Queue Implementation
- Write a menu-driven program to implement a Queue using arrays with the following operations:
  - a) Insert elements to the Queue.
  - b) Delete an element from the Queue.
  - c) Display the contents of the Queue.

#### 5. Circular Queue Implementation
- Write a menu-driven C program to implement a circular queue using arrays with the following operations:
  - a) Insert an element to the queue.
  - b) Delete an element from the queue.
  - c) Display the contents of the queue.

#### 6. Double-Ended Queue (DEQUEUE) Implementation
- Write a menu-driven C program to implement a Double-Ended Queue (DEQUEUE) with the following operations:
  - a) Insert elements to the Front of the queue.
  - b) Insert elements to the Rear of the queue.
  - c) Delete elements from the Front of the queue.
  - d) Delete elements from the Rear of the queue.
  - e) Display the contents of the queue.

#### 7. Priority Queue Implementation
- Write a menu-driven C program to implement a Priority Queue using arrays with the following operations:
  - a) Insert elements to the Priority Queue.
  - b) Delete elements from the Priority Queue.
  - c) Display the contents of the Priority Queue.

#### 8. Infix to Postfix Expression Conversion and Evaluation
- Write a menu-driven C program to do the following using a stack:
  - a) Convert an infix expression to a postfix expression.
  - b) Evaluate the postfix expression.

#### 9. Employee Structure and Linear Search
- Write a C program to create a structure named Employee with fields EmpId, Name, and Salary.
- Store the details of N employees, dynamically allocating memory for the same.
- Write a function to implement Linear Search to search for a particular employee, given the EmpId.

#### 10. Student Names Sorting and Binary Search
- Write a C program to read student names stored in a file.
- Sort the names in alphabetical order using bubble sort.
- Implement binary search to search for a given name.
- Implement sort and search routines as separate functions.
